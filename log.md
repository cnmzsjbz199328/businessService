C:\Users\tj169\OneDr…\services\api.ts:85 Gemini API response: Okay, here's my assessment and recommendation for the product "tesla" based on the provided data:

**Recommendation: Hold**

**Justification:**

*   **Neutral Sentiment:** The neutral sentiment score (0.26) indicates there's no strong positive or negative feeling surrounding the product. This suggests demand is likely to remain consistent.
*   **Stable Trend:** The "stable" trend with a slight decrease of -4.92% over six months confirms that demand is relatively constant. A decrease of less than 5% can be considered stable.

**Estimated Number of Units:**

Since the trend is stable, I recommend maintaining the current inventory levels. To determine the specific number of units to hold, I would need additional information:

*   **Current Inventory Level:** What is the current stock level of "tesla"?
*   **Sales Velocity:** How many units of "tesla" are sold per month or week?
*   **Lead Time:** How long does it take to restock "tesla" once an order is placed?
*   **Safety Stock:** What is the desired safety stock level to avoid stockouts?

**Example:**

Let's say you currently have 100 units of "tesla" in stock, you sell 20 units per month, the lead time is 1 month, and you want a safety stock of 20 units.

*   **Demand during lead time:** 20 units/month * 1 month = 20 units
*   **Reorder point:** 20 units (demand during lead time) + 20 units (safety stock) = 40 units

In this case, you would reorder when your inventory level reaches 40 units. Since the trend is stable, you would reorder 20 units to bring your inventory back to 100 units.

Without these details, I can only advise maintaining the current levels and closely monitoring sales data to adjust the strategy if the sentiment or trend changes.
