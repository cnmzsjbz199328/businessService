I hope she told her parents or was asked by someone afterward why it was that she was crying. If you look at the boy's face he looks down before and while likely squeezing her hand; unintentionally giving away what he was about to do and then looks away from her trying to act as if he didn't know why she was crying and smirking as if he was happy with himself. These types of behaviors must be disciplined correctly and timely or people grow up to potentially be bullies in school and potentially abusive to others as adults.","sentiment":-2},{"comment":"What is she crying like that in church","sentiment":0},{"comment":"Shut up god","sentiment":1},{"comment":"2050","sentiment":0},{"comment":"2040","sentiment":0},{"comment":"/😮","sentiment":0},{"comment":"😂","sentiment":0},{"comment":"Noob","sentiment":-2}]* Connection #0 to host 34.87.252.115 left intact
